# RusTeX

RusTeX is a simple command-line utility written in Rust for compiling LaTeX files to PDF format. It provides an easy-to-use interface for converting `.tex` files into `.pdf` files using the `pdflatex` compiler.

## Features

- Compile LaTeX files to PDF format.
- Minimal setup required.
- Cross-platform compatibility (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux).

## Requirements

- Rust programming language installed (https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- LaTeX distribution with `pdflatex` command (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX, BasicTeX, etc.)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed that includes `pdflatex`. You can install TeX Live (https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or MiKTeX (https://miktex.org/) for this purpose.
3. Compile the RustLatex project:
    ```bash
    rustc main.rs
    ```
4. Run the executable with the input LaTeX file and desired output PDF file as arguments:
    ```bash
    ./main input.tex output.pdf
    ```
    Replace `input.tex` with the path to your LaTeX file and `output.pdf` with the desired name for the output PDF file.

    The `output.pdf` file will be created in the src directory.

## Example

Compile a LaTeX file named `example.tex` to produce `example.pdf`:
```bash
./latex_compiler example.tex example.pdf
```

## Warnings

- You may encounter warnings or errors during the compilation process. These are typically related to the OS itself and not the RusTeX utility.
    - A common warning is "Error moving out PDF file: No such file or directory (os error 2)". This is due to the fact that the PDF file is still being generated when the utility tries to move it. This warning can be safely ignored.

## FQA

- "Why does it generate an .aux and a .log file?"
    - These files are generated by the LaTeX compiler as part of the compilation process. They are used for various purposes such as cross-referencing, citations, and error logging.
